# Project Name: Canadina_Immigration_DV
Consider the Canadian Immigration Data set. It is available in Github as well as Kaggle. Using this I perform data manipulation and based on that Data Visualization using python libraries. Libraries that are used here are - **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **pandas**, **seaborn** etc.

### Data Manipulation

The technique to change or transform a data set into another format, so that we can easily use plotting functions on them. Data manipulation basically helps us by providing the mother data set of plottng. For example, suppose we have a data set that has column **Name**. If we can change the index of the data frame by name then we can easily access the rows using those names as loc or iloc parameters.
