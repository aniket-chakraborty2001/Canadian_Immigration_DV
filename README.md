959# Project Name: Canadina_Immigration_DV
Consider the Canadian Immigration Data set. It is available in Github as well as Kaggle. Using this I perform data manipulation and based on that Data Visualization using python libraries. Libraries that are used here are - **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **pandas**, **seaborn** etc.

## Data Manipulation

The technique to change or transform a data set into another format, so that we can easily use plotting functions on them. Data manipulation basically helps us by providing the mother data set of plottng. For example, suppose we have a data set that has column **Name**. If we can change the index of the data frame by name then we can easily access the rows using those names as loc or iloc parameters. Python library **pandas** is considered as most important data manipulation library, as most of the data manipulation functions come under this library.

## Data Visualization

It is the techniqe of graphically visualizing the data to understand the hidden patterns or making insights from them easily. The advantage of using data visualization is it makes the data story telling very easy, efficient and to the point. Data visualization can be static by graph of runs a  player make or can be dynamic (real time data) like stock market price graph. There are many libraries to create live interactive Dashboards to make plot interactive. The libraries **matplotlib**, **seaborn** creates statisc graphs where as **plotly**, **folium** creates live interactive graphs. **Folium** is used to represent geospatial data effectively.

## About the Cnadian Immigration Data Set

Here we consider the Canadian Immigration Data set. This data set contains information of number of immigrants that came to Canada during the time period 1980 to 2013 for some reasons. It may be Economical crisis (like Pakistan and India) or it may be Natural Phenomenon (like Haiti, 2010 earthquake). This data set 195 rows/observation and 39 columns. Each row/observation represents each country. These 195 countries are grouped into 6 Continents. They are - **Asia**, **Europe**, **Africa**, **Oceania**, **Northern America** and **Latin America and Caribbean**. The columns 1980 to 2013 gives the number of immigrants to Canada in this time gap. Also total number of Immigrants from each country is included in this data set and represented by the **Total** column.

## Project Stages

I gone through some stages to finish the project and making it a well organized one. The stages of the project are well described and to the point. In the project, all the steps are done with notations, so that there will be no problem to understand each part of the project. The steps of the project are -
